# JavaScript30
Participating in 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenges by @wesbos

# How to navigate in this
I always try to find out the solution before watching what solution @wesbos propose. This is the reason why this repository has two branches :
## draft
The draft branch contains my first approaches to the challenges to be met. This code is the way i solved or trying to solve the challenges given by wesbos.
## master
The master branch contains the final code for each challenge. It is the the way i improve my code (what i did in draft branch) after watching wesbos tutorials.
## Logs
Here are the journal about my Javascript30 coding sessions :
### Day 1 - 30 Dec 2019
