Participating in 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenges by @wesbos

# How to navigate in this
I always try to find out the solution before watching what solution @wesbos propose. This is the reason why this repository has two branches :
## draft
The draft branch contains my first approaches to the challenges to be met. This code is the way i solved or trying to solve the challenges given by wesbos.
## master
The master branch contains the final code for each challenge. It is the the way i improve my code (what i did in draft branch) after watching wesbos tutorials.
## Logs
Here are the journal about my Javascript30 coding sessions :
### Day 1 - 30 Dec 2019
### Toughts
It takes me a bit of time to found the way i can grab the keyboard pressed key without listening the event on a specific HTML element. But when i found it out, it was a lot easier to make the drumkit works. After all, i felt that my code needed to be improved after watching @wesbos solution.
#### What i've learned :
- transitionend Event : Understand case of use of the transitionend event
- es6 : Push me to learn more about es6

### Day 2 - 30 Dec 2019
### Toughts
i just coudn't make it works myself. So i watched @wesbos solution before getting into my code.
#### What i've learned :
- Methods **getSeconds()** and **getMinutes()** count to 59 and not to 60. **getHours()** counts to 11 and not to 12.
